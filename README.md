Lip to Speech Project

Welcome to the Lip to Speech project repository. This project aims to convert lip movements into speech using computer vision techniques and machine learning algorithms. This README provides an overview of the project, its contents, and instructions for usage.

Project Overview:
The Lip to Speech project utilizes computer vision algorithms to analyze lip movements captured via a camera feed. These movements are then translated into speech using machine learning models trained on lip reading datasets. The project aims to provide a seamless and efficient way for individuals with speech impairments to communicate.

Contents:
Changes Made Files:
This directory contains the updated HTML and CSS files that implement the lip to speech functionality.
Documentation:
Detailed documentation outlining the project's objectives, methodologies, implementation details, and usage instructions.
Relevant Images and Videos:
Images: Snapshots depicting the UI design, lip reading process, and any other relevant visuals related to the project.
Videos: A video recording demonstrating the working prototype of the lip to speech system. This provides a visual representation of how the system interprets lip movements and converts them into speech.

Note:
Please be informed that this repository solely contains the frontend part of the Lip to Speech project, including HTML and CSS files, along with relevant images and videos demonstrating the application's functionality. Due to remote repository errors, other components such as backend scripts, machine learning models, and additional documentation are not uploaded here.
